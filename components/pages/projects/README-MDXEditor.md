## Technical Implementation

### Dynamic Loading
The editor is dynamically loaded with SSR disabled to prevent hydration issues:

```typescript
const Editor = dynamic(() => import('./mdx-editor-initialized'), {
  ssr: false,
  loading: () => <LoadingComponent />
})
```

### Plugin Configuration
The editor includes a comprehensive set of plugins for full markdown support:
- Core markdown features (headings, lists, quotes)
- Advanced features (tables, code blocks, images)
- UI enhancements (toolbar, source mode toggle)

### Styling Integration
Custom CSS classes ensure proper integration with the existing design system while providing rich markdown formatting.

2. **Markdown Support**: Full markdown syntax support
3. **Visual Hierarchy**: Proper styling for all markdown elements
4. **Accessibility**: Better focus states and keyboard navigation
5. **Flexibility**: Source mode for advanced users
6. **Integration**: Seamless integration with existing form structure
